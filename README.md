# SH72AL
Firmware for the [alternative SH72 soldering iron controller](https://oshwlab.com/AntaresLab/sh72al1) with turbo mode, two-stage sleep mode, grounding the soldering iron tip to a "-" power wire and the protection against the reverse polarity, short circuit and overvoltage.

The firmware is designed for the ATtini13(A) MCU and works with the factory-setted fuse bits.
PCB project and other more complete information can be found [here](https://oshwlab.com/AntaresLab/sh72al1).

At the moment, the board and MCU firmware have been developed, but not tested yet.

Pay attention that the first commits were made for another PCB. Last commits are applicable for the ver.1 rev.B PCB.
