# SH72AL
Firmware for the [alternative SH72 soldering iron controller](https://oshwlab.com/AntaresLab/SH72) with turbo mode, two-stage sleep mode, grounding the soldering iron tip to a "-" power wire and the protection against the reverse polarity, short circuit and overvoltage.

The firmware is designed for the ATtini13 MCU and works with the factory-setted fuse bits. Should be compiled with -O1 optimization level.
PCB project and other more complete information can be found [here](https://oshwlab.com/AntaresLab/SH72).

At the moment, the board and MCU firmware have been developed, but not tested yet, since the boards have not arrived from the factory yet.
